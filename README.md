# Privy Smart Wallet Next.js Starter

Welcome to this starter kit for building onchain applications! This project demonstrates how to build a modern web3 application using Next.js, Privy, and WAGMI. It's designed to help you understand core web3 concepts and how to implement them in a production-ready application.

## Why These Technologies?

### Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that provides:

- Server-side rendering for better performance and SEO
- File-based routing for easy navigation
- API routes for backend functionality
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Excellent developer experience

### Privy

Privy is a powerful authentication and wallet management solution that offers:

- **Embedded Wallets**: Non-custodial wallets that users can create with just an email or social login
- **Smart Wallets**: Programmable wallets that can execute complex transactions
- Seamless onboarding for web3 newbies
- Secure key management

### WAGMI

WAGMI (We're All Gonna Make It) is a React Hooks library for Ethereum that:

- Provides easy-to-use hooks for interacting with Ethereum
- Handles wallet connections and chain switching
- Manages transaction states and error handling
- Integrates seamlessly with Privy

## What You'll Learn

This starter kit demonstrates:

- How to set up Privy authentication
- Creating and managing embedded wallets
- Using smart wallets for complex transactions
- Signing messages and sending USDC transactions
- Switching between different networks (Base and Base Sepolia)
- Displaying wallet balances
- Building a responsive UI with NextUI

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/builders-garden/privy-advanced-wallets
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Privy App ID (learn how to get one [here](https://docs.privy.io/basics/get-started/dashboard/create-new-app)):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your application in action.

## Project Structure

### Core Application

- `app/`: Contains the main application pages and layout
  - `page.tsx`: Main application page with the dashboard layout
  - `layout.tsx`: Root layout with providers and global styles

### Components

The application is built using modular components that handle specific functionality:

#### Authentication & Wallet Management

- `Header.tsx`: Navigation bar with wallet connection and network switching
- `EmbeddedWallets.tsx`: Manages embedded wallet creation and connection
- `WalletInfo.tsx`: Displays information about the connected embedded wallet
- `SmartWallets.tsx`: Handles smart wallet creation and management
- `SmartWalletInfo.tsx`: Shows details about the connected smart wallet

#### Transaction Components

- `USDCTransaction.tsx`: Handles USDC transfers using embedded wallets
- `SmartUSDCTransaction.tsx`: Manages USDC transfers using smart wallets
- `SignMessage.tsx`: Component for signing messages with embedded wallets
- `SmartSignMessage.tsx`: Component for signing messages with smart wallets

#### UI Components

- `Tabs.tsx`: Tab navigation component for switching between different features
- `Providers.tsx`: Sets up all necessary providers (Privy, WAGMI, etc.)

### Supporting Files

- `lib/`: Core configuration and utility files

  - `constants.ts`: Network configurations and contract addresses
  - `wagmi.ts`: WAGMI client configuration and setup
  - `utils.ts`: Helper functions for common operations

- `public/`: Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
